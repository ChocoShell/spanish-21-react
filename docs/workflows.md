# Workflows

## Goal

I am trying to create a completely front end [Spanish 21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_21) game to teach myself React 16.8+.

## Components

- Spanish21
    - Dealer
    - Shoe
    - Player
    - Card

## Functionality

- dealCardToPlayer
- dealCardToDealer
- dealCard
- What happens at game start?
    - What happens at round start?
- How to add and remove players?
- What happens when a player hits 21?
- What happens when a dealer has 21 before anyone else?
- How do we trigger conditional state calls? (Check if players go bust and then setting the next player)
- How do we trigger on changes in state? (When dealer becomes active)

### Tech Debt

- Rewrite to use hooks


## User Interface

- Users should have ability to bet, hit, stay, increase bet, decrease bet, etc.
